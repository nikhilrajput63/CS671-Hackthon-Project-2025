# 🎬 Mood-Based Movie Detection
IIT Mandi Hackathon 2025 Project

This project recommends movies based on a user's current emotional state using AI-powered mood detection. Developed during the IIT Mandi Hackathon 2025, it leverages facial expression analysis and/or text sentiment analysis to classify the user's mood and suggest appropriate movies tailored to their feelings.

# 📁 Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

face_expression_recommendation/: Implements mood detection through facial expression analysis using computer vision techniques.
text_emoji_recommendation/: Analyzes textual input and emojis to determine the user's mood.
voice_recommendation/: (If implemented) Utilizes voice tone analysis for mood detection.

Each directory contains specific modules and scripts pertinent to its respective mood detection method.

# 🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)

> Each directory contains its own readme and requirements.txt file
> so create the conda enviroment accroding to the python version as suggested in directory
    for example: conda create --name myenv python==3.9
                 conda activate myenv
> then run the install the requirement: pip install -r requirements.txt
> Now run the app.py


## 📌 Future Enhancements
Integrate all three mood detection methods into a unified application.
Enhance the accuracy of mood detection algorithms.
Expand the movie database for more diverse recommendations.
Develop a user-friendly GUI for better interaction.
