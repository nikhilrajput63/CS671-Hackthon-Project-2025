# üé¨ Mood-Based Movie Detection
IIT Mandi Hackathon 2025 Project

This project recommends movies based on a user's current emotional state using AI-powered mood detection. Developed during the IIT Mandi Hackathon 2025, it leverages facial expression analysis and/or text sentiment analysis to classify the user's mood and suggest appropriate movies tailored to their feelings.

# üìÅ Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. face_expression_recommendation/: Implements mood detection through facial expression analysis using computer vision techniques.
2. text_emoji_recommendation/: Analyzes textual input and emojis to determine the user's mood.
3. voice_recommendation/: (If implemented) Utilizes voice tone analysis for mood detection.

Each directory contains specific modules and scripts pertinent to its respective mood detection method.

# üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Git

# Installation
1. Each directory contains its own readme and requirements.txt file
   
3. Create the conda enviroment accroding to the python version as suggested in directory
    for example: conda create --name myenv python==3.9
                , conda activate myenv
   
4. run the install the requirement: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Now run the app.py


## üìå Future Enhancements
Integrate all three mood detection methods into a unified application.
Enhance the accuracy of mood detection algorithms.
Expand the movie database for more diverse recommendations.
Develop a user-friendly GUI for better interaction.
